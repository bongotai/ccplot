CCPLOT NEWS

New in 1.4.1 (2010-05-13):

    * Wrong dimension mapping of MODIS Swath near 180E was fixed.
    * Missing meridians on polar plots were fixed.
    * Projection options like central latitude, central meridian,
      bounding latitude and latitude of true scale
      can now be set with the -p switch.
    * Wrong interpolation radius calculation on Equidistant Cylindrical
      plots was fixed.
    * Ticks on profile plot are now more dense by default.
    * Sufrace elevation line can now be plotted for CALIPSO profile products
      (and is on by default).

New in 1.4 (2010-05-07):

    * The way aspect ratio is specified was changed.
    * Vertical extent is now set by -y instead of -v.
    * Horizontal extent can now be expressed in terms of geographical
      coordinates for swath plot types.
    * Tick on trajectories can be specified by the newly introduced
      trajticks and trajnminortics options.
    * ccplot now checks libraries versions at start-up.
    * -V print version flag was added.
    * -v be verbose flag was added.
    * The way plot layout is constructed was rewritten. Newly added
      options plotheight, padding and cbspacing can be used to control
      the layout.
    * -z options parsing would cash the program instead of failing. Fixed.
    * Default output filename now set to ccplot.png.
    * List of available projections and options is not printed as part of
      the help output, but can be printed by -p help and -z help (resp.)
    * Insufficient memory error condition is now handled gracefully.
    * Colormap files are now searched for in some default locations first.

	* Fixed singular matrix bug with CloudSat profile products.
	* Traceback no longer reported when trying to plot a product
	  that is not contained within a data file.
