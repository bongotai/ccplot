INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

ccplot is intended to be installed on unix-like operating systems:
Linux, Mac OS and Solaris.

More complete installation instructions can be found at http://www.ccplot.org/.


1 DEPENDENCIES

The following programs are required for installation of ccplot:

    1. gcc and g++
    2. libpng 1.1 or newer, freetype 1.4 or newer, and cairo
    3. Python 2.5 or 2.6 and development files
	4. numpy 1.1 or newer
	5. matplotlib 0.98.1 or newer
	6. basemap 0.99.4 or newer and the GEOS library (shipped with basemap)
	7. PyNIO 1.3.0b1 or newer


2 INSTALLATION OF DEPENDENCIES

    (i) gcc and g++, the C and C++ compilers. The GNU Compiler Collection should
       generally be available on any modern unix-like operating system.
       Try the packaging system if your OS has one, or the OS installation
       media.

    (ii) libpng[1] 1.1 or newer, freetype[2] 1.4 or newer, and cairo[3].
       It is very likely that you have these installed, or that they
       are in your packaging system.
         
           1: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
           2: http://www.freetype.org/
           3: http://cairographics.org/
    
    (iii) Python[4] 2.5 or 2.6 and development files. If you use a modern OS with
       a packaging system, you will almost certainly find it there.
       You will have to install Python development files as well. On Debian
       and Ubuntu, the package is called python-dev.
       
           4: http://www.python.org/download/
              
    (iv) numpy[5] 1.1 or newer. Again, if your OS has a packaging system,
       it is likely that numpy is there.
       
           5: http://numpy.scipy.org/
    
    (v) matplotlib[6] 0.98.1 or newer. Not so common in package repositories,
       although Debian and Ubuntu have a sufficiently recent version.
       
           6: http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/
           
    (vi) basemap[7] 0.99.4 or newer and the GEOS library (shipped with basemap).
       Basemap is rare in packaging systems.
       
           7: http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/
       
       After you have downloaded the source distribution, unpack, build
       and install using the following commands:

           $ tar xzf basemap-0.99.4.tar.gz
           $ cd basemap-0.99.4.tar.gz
           $ cd geos-2.2.3
           $ export GEOS_DIR=/usr/local        (on C shell:
                                                setenv GEOS_DIR /usr/local)
           $ ./configure --prefix=$GEOS_DIR
           $ make
           # make install                      (as root)
           $ cd ..
           $ python setup.py build
           # python setup.py install           (as root)
    
           Test installation (optional):
           $ python -c "import mpl_toolkits.basemap as b; print b.__version__"
           0.99.4

       If that doesn't work for you, follow the instructions in README under
       the basemap-0.99.4 directory.

    (vii) PyNIO 1.3.0b1 or newer. PyNIO can be downloaded upon free registration
    from ESG[8]. However, to make your life easier, you can also download PyNIO
    precompiled binaries without registration[9] from our website (recommended).
    Installing PyNIO from source is very difficult. If you want to go through
    the ordeal of building PyNIO from the source code, follow the instructions
    on the PyNIO website[10].

        9: http://localhost/ccplot/download/pynio.shtml
        10: http://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Download/build_pynio_from_src.shtml
        
     To install PyNIO from a binary distribution:

        On Ubuntu and Debian with Python 2.6:
        $ mkdir pynio
        $ tar -C pynio -xzf PyNIO-1.3.0b5.linux-x86_64-py264-gcc432.tar.gz
        (substitute with the name of the binary you downloaded)
        # cp -r pynio/lib/python2.6/site-packages/* /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/
        (as root)
        
        On other systems:
        # tar -C /usr/local -xzf PyNIO-1.3.0b1.linux-x86_64-gcc4-2.5.tar.gz
        (as root; substitute with the name of the binary you downloaded)
    
        Test installation (optional):
        $ python -c "import Nio; print Nio.__version__"
        1.3.0b1
        
    PyNIO binary is not distributed under an open-source licese
    because of third-party libraries it uses, altough the conditions
    are very permissive.


3 INSTALLATION OF CCPLOT

Installing ccplot from the source distribution is easy.

   1. Unpack the archive:

          $ tar xzf ccplot-1.44.tar.gz

   2. Go to the source code directory and build the source code:

          $ cd ccplot-1.44
          $ python setup.py build

   3. Log in as root and install ccplot:

          # python setup.py install

      Alternatively, use sudo if your OS supports it:

          $ sudo python setup.py install
