Installation instructions
=========================

ccplot is indended to be installed on unix-like operation systems.


1. REQUIREMENTS

(a) List of required programs

The following programs are required by ccplot:

	Python 2.6 (or later)
	PyNIO 1.3.0b1 (or later)
	numpy 1.1 (or later)
	libpng 1.1 (or later)
	freetype 1.4 (or later)
	matplotlib 0.98.1 (or later)
	basemap 0.99.4 (or later) and libraries shipped with basemap

(b) Installing Python

Python 2.6 is likely to be a part of your OS distribution,
or in the OS packaging system. If it is not, you can download it at
http://www.python.org/.

(c) Installing PyNIO

PyNIO is the most cumbersome dependency. It can be downloaded
from the EOS (Earth System Grid) web site; however, you will
need have an account first (anyone is free to create one, though).
Please follow the instructions at http://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Download/.

(d) Installing numpy

If numpy is not distrubuted with your OS, you can download it at
http://numpy.scipy.org/. numpy 1.1 is fairly common amongst stable
linux distrubutions.

(e) Installing libpng and freetype

These are very likely to be in your OS distrubution. libpng can be
downloaded at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html, and FreeType can be
downloaded at http://www.freetype.org/.

(f) Installing matplotlib, basemap and dependent libraries

ccplot requires a recent version of matplotlib (>= 0.98.1). You will need
an approporiate version of basemap, the best would be at least 0.99.4,
but you may succeed with 0.99.1 and newer.
You can download both of them at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/.

For more information about installing matplotlib and dependent libraries, go to
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/installing.html.

For more information about installing basemap and dependent libraries, go to
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/basemap/doc/html/users/installing.html.


2. INSTALLING CCPLOT

Once you installed required libraries you can build and install ccplot
and its cctk extension module by the following commands:

    $ python setup.py build
    # python setup.py install   (as root)
