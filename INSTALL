INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

ccplot is intended to be installed on unix-like operating systems:
Linux, Mac OS and Solaris.

More complete installation instructions can be found at http://www.ccplot.org/.


1 DEPENDENCIES

The following programs are required for installation of ccplot:

    1. gcc and g++
    2. libpng 1.1 (or newer) and freetype 1.4 (or newer)
    3. Python 2.5 (or newer)
	4. numpy 1.1 (or newer)
	5. matplotlib 0.98.1 (or newer)
	6. basemap 0.99.4 (or newer) and the GEOS library shipped with basemap
	7. PyNIO 1.3.0b1 (or newer)


2 INSTALLATION OF DEPENDENCIES

    1. gcc and g++, the C and C++ compilers. These should be generally available
       in any modern unix-like operating system. Try the packaging system if
       your OS has one, or OS distribution installation media. 

    2. libpng and freetype. It is very likely that you have these installed
       already, or at least they should be in your packaging system.
       If not, you can get them from:
         
           http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
           http://www.freetype.org/
    
    3. Python 2.5 or newer and development files. If you use a modern OS
       with a packaging system, you will almost certainly find it there.
       If not, you can get it from:
       
           http://www.python.org/download/
       
       You will have to install the Python development files as well,
       usually the package is called python-dev (on Debian and Ubuntu). 
       
    4. numpy 1.1 or newer. Again, if your OS has a packaging system,
       it is likely that numpy is there. If not, you can get it from:
       
           http://numpy.scipy.org/
    
    5. matplotlib 0.98.1 or newer. matplotlib is not as common in
       OS distributions as Python or numpy. Current stable versions
       of Debian and Ubuntu have a sufficiently recent version of matplotlib
       in their repositories. You are not lucky, you can get it from:
       
           http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/
           
    6. basemap 0.99.4 or newer and the GEOS library. Basemap is rare
       in packaging systems. You can get a version of your choice from:
       
           http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/
       
       under matplotlib-toolkits. After you have downloaded the source
       distribution, unpack, build and install using the following commands:

           $ tar xzf basemap-0.99.4.tar.gz
           $ cd basemap-0.99.4.tar.gz
           $ cd geos-2.2.3
           $ export GEOS_DIR=/usr/local        (on C shell:
                                                setenv GEOS_DIR /usr/local)
           $ ./configure --prefix=$GEOS_DIR
           $ make
           # make install                      (as root)
           $ cd ..
           $ python setup.py build
           # python setup.py install           (as root)
    
           Test installation (optional):
           $ python -c "import mpl_toolkits.basemap as b; print b.__version__"
           0.99.4

       If that doesn't work for you, follow the instructions in README under
       the basemap-0.99.4 directory. 

    7. PyNIO 1.3.0b1 or newer. PyNIO can be downloaded upon free registration
    from ESG. However, to make your life easier, you can also download PyNIO
    precompiled binaries without registration from our website (recommended):
    
        http://www.ccplot.org/download/
    
    Installing PyNIO from source is very difficult. If you want to go through
    the ordeal of building PyNIO from the source code, follow the instructions
    on the PyNIO website. To install PyNIO from a binary distribution:

        $ tar -C /usr/local -xzf PyNIO-1.3.0b1.linux-x86_64-gcc4-2.5.tar.gz
        (substitute with the name of binary you downloaded)
    
        Test installation (optional):
        $ python -c "import Nio; print Nio.__version__"
        1.3.0b1


3 INSTALLATION OF CCPLOT

Installing ccplot from the source distribution is easy.

   1. Unpack the archive:

          $ tar xzf ccplot-1.42.tar.gz

   2. Go to the source code directory and build the source code:

          $ cd ccplot-1.42
          $ python setup.py build

   3. Log in as root and install ccplot:

          # python setup.py install

      Alternatively, use sudo if your OS supports it:

          $ sudo python setup.py install
