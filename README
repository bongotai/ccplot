Overview of ccplot
==================

ccplot is a python program that reads CloudSat, CALISO and Aqua MODIS HDF
and HDF-EOS data files, and produces plots of profile, layer and swath
products.

The following products are supported:

	CloudSat Reflectivity Factor
	CALIPSO L1B Total Attenuated Backscatter 532nm
 	CALIPSO L1B Perpendicular Attenuated Backscatter 532nm
	CALIPSO L1B Attenuated Backscatter 1064nm
	CALIPSO L1B Attenuated Color Ratio 1064nm/532nm
	CALIPSO L1B Depolarization Ratio
	CALIPSO L2 Integrated Attenuated Backscatter 532nm
	CALIPSO L2 Integrated Attenuated Backscatter 1064nm
	CALIPSO L2 Integrated Attenuated Total Color Ratio 1064nm/532nm
	CALIPSO L2 Integrated Volume Depolarization Ratio
	CALIPSO L2 Midlayer Temperature
	CloudSat trajectory
	CALIPSO trajectory
	Aqua MODIS radiance and reflectance bands (except band 26)
